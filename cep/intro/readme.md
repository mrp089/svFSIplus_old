## Cardiac Electrophysiology Simulation using **svFSI**

The electrical activity in a heart is initiated at the sinoatrial node, which is located at the right atrium of the heart. A small cluster of pacemaker cells periodically emits electrical signals into the heartâ€™s conduction system. These signals first travel at a high speed through a network of special cells that allows the signals to reach the whole heart rapidly. Finally, they travel into the ventricular muscles, and cause the entire heart to contract almost simultaneously. The electrical signals travel between cells through a process called depolarization, during which voltage-sensitive protein channels on the cell membrane open to allow positively charged ions to move in and out of the cell, leading to ionic currents.
