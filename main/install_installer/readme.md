### Precompiled installer

If you intent to use the stable version, we provide a precompiled installer on <a href="https://simtk.org/projects/simvascular">SimTK</a> website. We currently support Ubuntu and MacOS. It is recommended to install **svFSI** alongside <strong>SimVascular</strong> to take advantage of the established modeling pipeline.

The **svFSI** executable (either built from source or downloaded from SimTK) is not packaged into each SimVascular release, so users have to manually add its path through **SimVascular** GUI. The configuration is under <code>Window</code> -> <code>Preference</code> -> <code>svFSI Simulation</code>.
