## Cardiac Mechanics Modeling using **svFSI**

Modeling cardiac mechanics is a challenging task as the heart muscle is a complex fibrous structure that is predominantly incompressible <a href="#ref-1">[1]</a>, and undergoes large deformation during a cardiac cycle. **svFSI** is designed specifically to tackles all these challenges. It has a robust implementation of nonlinear FEM for large deformation problems and several advanced fiber-reinforced hyperelastic material models. In the following sections, we will demonstrate **svFSI**'s capability in modeling cardiac mechanics using the benchmark example from Land et al. <a href="#ref-2">[2]</a>, i.e., the passive inflation of an idealized left ventricle. The complete example can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/SimVascular/svFSI-Tests/tree/master/05-struct/02-LV-Guccione-passive) and you can find the accompanying YouTube tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jm3VSi6Aci8&list=PL1CBZ8Wh-xvRnux0eMmbZPbx-C078Qzqu&index=2). We will also briefly explain the theory and implementation of nonlinear continuum mechanics in **svFSI**.
